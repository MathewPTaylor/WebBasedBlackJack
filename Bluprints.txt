Resetting a Password:
1. user inputs email
2. send resetting link to user's email
3. user clicks on link, which redirects them to a page to reset their password (webstie url will contain userid, so it can be pulled to access the database. We gotta find a way to prevent someone just inputting a random id and change a random person's password)
4. password for that use is changed to the new password
